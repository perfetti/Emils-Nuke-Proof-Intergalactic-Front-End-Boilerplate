Emil's Nuke-Proof, Intergalactic Boilerplate

A basic front end web boilerplate aimed at rapid set up for web projects.

SET-UP:

1. install node.js, bower.js and gulp.js
2. run npm install
3. run bower install
4. copy relevant files from bower_components into working directory by running 'gulp components'
5. run 'gulp' to compile, concat and minify all files to /dist
